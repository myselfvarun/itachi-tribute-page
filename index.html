          Itachi Uchiha (Japanese: うちは イタチ, Hepburn: Uchiha Itachi) is a
          fictional character in the Naruto manga and anime series created by
          Masashi Kishimoto. <br /><br />
          Integrity- Itachi teaches us that we should do what's right, even when
          no one is watching us or expecting us to do the right thing.

        <h2>Here's some information & my thoughts about Itachi</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Created by : </b> Masashi Kishimoto</li>
          <li><b>Nickname : </b> clan killer itachi</li>
          <li>One name is enough to learn a whole lot about life</li>
          <li>
            The saddest part about him was that he never had a life of his
            own.<br />
            He always <b> lived for others </b>, but we never saw him whining
            and complaining.
          </li>
        </ul>
